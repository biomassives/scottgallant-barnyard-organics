description:
  A very high protein diet for fast growth and a texture for young poultry.  The
  mash is a medium hammered texture, easy for young chicks to eat. The mash is preferred
  by many because it is not over-processed into pellets.  Cracked corn is used in
  the mash to minimize dust levels.
