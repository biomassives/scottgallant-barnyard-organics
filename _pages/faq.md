### Where can I find your products?

All of our feed, grain, Bio-Ag and General Seed products can be ordered directly from the farm!  The minimum order for shipping is 1/2 tonne (1100 lbs / 20*25Kg of our feed/grain bags).  No minimum order if you are stopping by the farm, but do call ahead to make sure we'll be available and have your order ready for pick-up!

East Coast Organic Grainery products are also available at retail stores across the Maritimes (see list of retailers on the Buy tab), and our retail distribution is rapidly increasing!  Check with your local feed retailer and ask them to order in East Coast Organic Grainery products!

For chicken and eggs, Sally's Chicken & Egg CSA is not taking new members at this time, but there are occasionally surplus so it doesn't hurt to ask. 

### Mash versus Pellet?

COMING SOON! In the meantime, [check out Sally's blog post about this topic](http://barnyardorganics.blogspot.ca/2017/04/lets-do-mash-chicken-mash.html)!
