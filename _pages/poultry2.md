    heading: Organic Mixed Grain Scratch 9.5%
    description:
      Our Mixed Grain Scratch, at 9.5% protein, provides an ideal supplement
      to all birds. Corn is cracked while the rest of the grains are whole.   Feeding
      whole grains with grit helps keep the bird’s gizzard strong and healthy and improves
      the flavour of the final product.

    heading: Organic Chick Starter Mash 21%
    description:
      A very high protein diet for fast growth and a texture for young poultry.  The
      mash is a medium hammered texture, easy for young chicks to eat. The mash is preferred
      by many because it is not over-processed into pellets.  Cracked corn is used in
      the mash to minimize dust levels.
